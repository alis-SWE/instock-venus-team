## Outline <a name="outline"></a>
The project is to build an Inventory Management System for a Fortune 500 client.
The system will be built by a team of developers using React, Node, Express, and mysql. The team will follow Agile methodology and use JIRA to manage the workflow.
A design tool called Figma will be used to create the mockups and style guide.
The team will also use Git/GitHub to collaborate and manage version control.
The project must adhere to functional and visual design requirements as specified in JIRA tickets.
The site must use multiple routes and proper folder structure and naming conventions for a full stack web application.
Third-party libraries can be used.
